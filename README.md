Vex Collective is a tool for visualizing your character's statistics using a variety of methods such as heatmaps, radar charts, and graphs.

A collection of data is pulled from the Destiny API and made available for easier navigation.

Vex Collective is a tool I created to explore the Destiny API and potentially provide some useful information for myself and anyone else.
